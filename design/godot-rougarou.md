# The Rougarou: the mall's first NPC (Godot mall, since Demo 25, Oct 14 2026)

**Asked for (Steven, Oct 14, 16:23):** "the first NPC that we'll have in the game ... the
Rougarou. It's a thing of Cajun folklore, a monster that's in the swamp, akin to a werewolf but
it's not." When you log in it's not there; after a few minutes you see it at the far side of the
mall, just standing; sometimes it shows up right behind you; very ominous, hunched over. It
doesn't attack. When you turn and see it, it runs: scatters off behind another wing or into a
store. His reference pictures: the Audubon Zoo's Rougarou sign, a swamp painting, a poster and a
Halloween animatronic — the mood, not a model.

## The figure (`scripts/rougarou.gd`)
- **The paradigm (Steven, 16:50): the old engraving "Le Rougarou, animal légendaire des Bayous de
  la Louisiane / Le Loup-garou des Créoles"**: a tall gaunt man-wolf stooped forward, the long
  back arched into a hump at the shoulders, the head thrust forward on the neck with the jaws
  open and the ears laid back, long sinewy arms hanging past the knees with clawed fingers, thin
  bent digitigrade legs in a stride, a bushy tail to the ground, a shaggy mane. The pose in
  `_pose()` is set to it; the first build (upright, head up, short arms) was "postured weird".
- Our own build from the folklore and that plate; no film or game creature is copied. Stooped,
  the top of its head is about 1.8 m up (it would be about 2.3 m upright).
- Built from primitives at runtime, no model file: a joint tree of Node3D pivots (`J`) carrying
  tapered cylinders and spheres; the fur is MultiMesh spikes riding each part (about 600 in all).
  Materials are flat colours; the eyes are emissive (energy 3) so they bloom at distance.
- Procedural animation in `_process`: breathing and a slow sway while standing; the head turns
  to `watch` (a world point) or scans; a lope when `gait` is 1 (legs and arms crossing, a bob, a
  lean, the jaw open). `hunch` 0..1 sets the pose.
- Faces -Z like a camera, so `look_at` points it at things.
- Cost: about 110 draw calls. Fine for one. If more appear, merge the body into one mesh.

## Stalk mode, the default since Demo 26 (Steven, Oct 14, 20:48)
"Make the rougarou immediately visible down the first long corridor you travel, in front of you at
a distance. If you try to get close to it it runs away. But you always see it at a distance."
- 1.5 s after the wing loads it stands 18–28 m ahead (`stalk_m`), in line of sight, within 30°
  of where the camera looks (`stalk_cone_deg`), facing the player. From the default spawn that
  is the far end of the main entrance hall, at the Shoe Dept. court.
- Walk within 12 m (`flee_m`) and it lopes off at 7.5 m/s (`flee_mps`) along the walk grid to the
  nearest tile at least 24 m away (`flee_to_m`) that the player can still see; only if there is
  none does it go round a corner. Then it stands and watches again. It never runs past the player.
- Out of sight (behind them, round a corner, or beyond 45 m, `lost_m`) for 1 s
  (`relocate_after_s`), it is put ahead of them again; if the view is short it widens the search.
- `"mode": "sightings"` in `rougarou.json` (or `?rougarou=now|behind`) brings back the cycle below.
- Check: `tools/qa/rougarou_stalk_test.gd` (STALK TEST OK, 10 checks); evidence
  `production/qa/evidence/d26-rougarou-stalk*.png`.

## Story mode, the default since Demo 28 (Steven, Oct 15, 06:45)
He played five minutes without a sighting, so it now follows a route set off by a place:
1. **Idle** until you walk into Pocket Change (past its threshold, by the Whirlwind) and back out.
2. **The window.** It stands stock-still (no breath, no scan; head turns to you once you are
   near) in Merry-Go-Round's right-hand window, exactly where the form stood; that form is its
   own mesh (`dyn_rg_mannequin`, `more.gd windows(own_k, own_group)`) and is hidden from now until
   the route ends. It stays stock-still until you are within 5 m (Demo 29, Steven Oct 15 07:47:
   "the only time you can get close"; it had bolted on the walk out of Pocket Change), then it
   runs to the back of the store and is gone.
3. **Cucos** (Wing 1). It stands at the doors. Within 16 m, or walking at it inside 22 m, it runs
   in and is gone.
4. **Woolworth.** It lurks at the back, turned to you, ducking to another spot out of your sight
   (5 m+ from where it was, 10 m+ from you, paths kept clear of the shelves) when you see it
   inside 22 m, come within 8 m, or every 6–11 s. A close look (seen within 10 m, shelves
   counted) and it runs and is gone.
5. Back to idle: the form returns to the window; Pocket Change starts it again.
- The stage survives crossing wings (`sessionStorage` "mall-rg"; `Engine` meta natively).
- Tunables `story_*` in `rougarou.json`; `?rougarou=s1|s2|s3` jumps to a stage, `?rougarou=stalk`
  the stalk mode below.
- Test `tools/qa/rougarou_story_test.gd` (STORY TEST OK, 18 checks); evidence
  `production/qa/evidence/d28-*`.

## Stalk tuning, Demo 27 (Steven, Oct 15, 05:16: "a happy medium")
- First appears 30 s into play (`stalk_first_s`), always ahead: 27–34 m off (`stalk_m`).
- Runs when you get within 24 m (`flee_m`, doubled from 12), toward the nearest tile out of
  sight, and is gone the moment it is out of view.
- Stays away a fresh random 30 s – 2 min every time (`reappear_s`), then stands ahead again.
- If there is no spot far enough ahead (a short hall), it waits out of sight instead of standing
  behind you.
- Test: `rougarou_stalk_test.gd --fast` (STALK TEST OK, 10 checks); evidence
  `production/qa/evidence/d27-rougarou-stalk-test.png`.

## The sightings cycle (`scripts/rougarou_ai.gd`, tunables in `scripts/rougarou.json`)
A node under the wing, made by `player.gd`. States:
- **hidden:** nothing for `first_sighting_s` (180 s) after the game starts, then
  `between_sightings_s` (45–120 s) between sightings.
- **far:** it stands, hunched, 25–45 m from the player (`far_m`) in their line of sight, with a
  70 % preference for somewhere behind them, head turned to them. Unseen for `stand_timeout_s`
  (40 s), it fades out.
- **behind:** `behind_m` (3.2 m) straight behind the player, facing them. From the second
  sighting on, `behind_chance` (30 %) of sightings are this. If the player turns and sees it, it
  bolts after `behind_look_to_bolt_s` (0.35 s); otherwise it leaves after `behind_timeout_s`.
- **bolt:** once looked at for `look_to_bolt_s` (1 s), it runs at `bolt_mps` (6.8 m/s) along the
  walk grid to the nearest tile at least `hide_m` (14 m) from the player and out of their line of
  sight (round a corner, into a side hall, into an open store), and vanishes there, or earlier
  once it has been out of sight for `gone_after_unseen_s`.
- **Seen** means: within `see_m` (70 m), inside `see_cone_deg` (28°) of the camera's forward,
  and the straight line to it crosses only walkable tiles (`_los`). Line of sight uses the walk
  grid, so glass storefronts count as walls; good enough for v1.
- It never collides with the player and never attacks.
- URL: `?rougarou=0` keeps it away; `?rougarou=now` brings the first sighting at once;
  `?rougarou=behind` makes it the behind-you one. Scheduled tests and screenshots are not
  affected: the first sighting is three minutes in.

## Checks
- `tools/qa/rougarou_shot.gd`: renders the figure in a studio (`--studio`) or in a wing at night
  (`--wing=1 --npc=x,z,yaw,hunch,gait --cam=...`).
- `tools/qa/rougarou_test.gd`: plays the cycle natively and prints ROUGAROU TEST OK: the far
  sighting in sight and in range, the bolt once looked at, the vanish, the behind-you sighting,
  its bolt. Screenshots at each beat.
- Evidence: `production/qa/evidence/d25-*`.

## Guessed, open
- Every number above is a first guess; Steven tunes `rougarou.json`.
- Not yet: sound (a breath, claws on terrazzo), a glimpse through a storefront, it watching from
  a store doorway, the day mode (it appears by day too for now), VR (it works, untested there).
- The bolt path can cut a corner of a storefront since it follows tile centres.
