## Framed newspaper ads on the mall's bare walls (Steven, Oct 14 2026): Courier ads he found for
## the mall's stores, hung "like posters around the mall ... in a frame that wraps around the
## dimensions of the actual file", sprinkled on the bare walls of the Sears wing and the side of
## Franks on the east hall.
##
## Each poster: a black anodised frame whose opening is the ad's own aspect (ads.json carries the
## pixel sizes; the longer side of the print is LONG metres), a white mat MAT wide, the print on
## matte paper, hung with its centre at EYE metres. Materials: "black" (the frame), "poster_mat" (the mat),
## "ad_<name>" (the print: tex/ads/<name>.png, build_mall.gd mat()). All of it is dynamic geometry
## (no rebake), group "posters" in the wing that owns the wall.
##
## PLACES names a plain wall by its layout endpoints (layout_mall.json edges of kind "wall") and the
## ads along it as fractions of its length; a wall that is no longer in the layout is skipped with
## a warning, so a layout change never crashes the build.
##
## Not mall tenants: Scatterbar's (1832 West Park) and Radiofone (Houma office). Steven sent them
## with the rest on Oct 14; pull them from PLACES if he says so.
