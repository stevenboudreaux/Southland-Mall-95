"""The mall's outside, from the 1995 map: tools/exterior/exterior.gd builds the exterior scene
(wing 3, "Outside") from what this writes to exterior.json.

  - segments: the building's outline, one run per (store, side), with the outward normal, in
    metres (+x east, +z south, the same frame as layout_mall.json)
  - roofs: the building's footprint as rectangles (one per run of map rows), for the roof slab
  - doors: every exterior door of the walkable mall (the exits and the main entrance), with the
    spot just outside it, the spot just inside it, the wing that spot is in and the facing
  - standalone: footprints of buildings on the map that do not touch the mall (n2, the
    nameless block west of the back lot: by Steven's account the original 1969 standalone Sears,
    Unitech in 2026)
  - walk: the wing's walkable grid (every map tile outside the building; the lot's obstacles
    come from the scene's collide.json)
Run: python3 tools/make_exterior.py ../../../index.html
