"""Opens the customer areas of fully built stores in layout_mall.json's walk grid.

convert_map.py marks every store tile as blocked; stores built in full 3D
(design/storefronts/*.md) let the player walk in. Each entry lists the map
tiles (x, y ranges, inclusive) that become floor; the furniture and counters
are obstacles placed by the store's builder. Run after convert_map.py:
  python3 tools/open_interiors.py   (from the project folder)
